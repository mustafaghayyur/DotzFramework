When Composer updates the framework, all core files should be updated automatically.

However, the files and folders that:
	
	php vendor/dotz/framework/dotz setup

...copied over to the root of your application, will not be updated automatically.

This is to protect you from loosing your valuable configurations.


## What you should do:
===================================================


	1) Run the following command in the command line after every composer update:
	
		php vendor/dotz/framework/dotz update

	This will update the documentation folder with the latest documentation.

	
	2) Test for any new exceptions thrown in your existing app. If some used property or method has been renamed/removed an exception will be thrown with some message declaring an Update Error and providing guidance on how to remedy the problem:

		Notice:
		Update Error: <--explaination of how to fix the error-->

	When you find an error/exception/systemMessage that declares an Update Error, follow the instructions to fix the problem and get rid of the issue.

	Please note there are times, when an update modification simply cannot be handled by Dotz Framework's Error Handling logic, and a raw PHP Error is thrown. We are cautious to make sure that does not happen often. 

	Please also read the documentation/ChangeLog.txt file for instructions when you update dotz/framework. 

	If you get stuck after an update, feel free to reach us at info@web-dotz.com with a screen shot of your error message, and some basic server environment details, and we would love to help if we can.
